It is \ntherefore important to understand how im ages can be sampled and how that \nrelates to the various neighborhoods that can be used to process an image.  \u2022 Rectangular sampling \u2013 In most cases, images are sampled by laying a rectangular grid over an image as illustrated in Figure 1. This results in the type of \nsampling shown in Figure 3ab.  \u2022 Hexagonal sampling \u2013 An alternative sa mpling scheme is shown in Figure 3c \nand is termed hexagonal sampling.

Local operations produce an output pixel value b[m=m\no,n=no] based upon the \npixel values in the neighborhood  of a[m=mo,n=no]. Some of the most common \nneighborhoods are the 4-connected neighborhood and the 8-connected \nneighborhood in the case of rectangul ar sampling and the 6-connected \nneighborhood in the case of hexagonal sampling illustrated in Figure 3.  \n \n Figure 3a Figure 3b Figure 3c \n Rectangular sampling Rectangular sampling Hexagonal sampling", "neighborhood in the case of hexagonal sampling illustrated in Figure 3.  \n \n Figure 3a Figure 3b Figure 3c \n Rectangular sampling Rectangular sampling Hexagonal sampling \n 4-connected 8-connected 6-connected \n2.3 VIDEO PARAMETERS  \nWe do not propose to describe the processing of dynamically changing images in \nthis introduction.
